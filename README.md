defrag-install
==============

A script to help you install the game DeFRaG

By running this script you agree to the EULA:  

http://ioquake3.org/extras/patch-data/  

I strongly encourage you to read over the script before you run it.  

You still need to use your copy of pak0.pk3 and put it in the ioquake3/baseq3/ directory  

then you can run iodfengine.x86_64 and everything should work  

I recommend creating a config file from http://newbrict.com/quake/dfcfg/  

enjoy :)
